# TypeScript basic types

## First steps
- Open the downloaded directory and set the project:
- `cd solution`
- `code . -r`
- Install dependencies:
- `npm i`

## Tasks
- Open the [practice-ts-primitives.ts](./practice-ts-primitives.ts) file.
- Make variables based on the comments.
- Open the [practice-ts-collections.ts](./practice-ts-collections.ts) file.
- Make variables based on the comments.

## Testing
- Open the terminal and run the following command:
- `npm test`
- To run individual tests of files, you can run subtests:
  - For primitives: `npm run test:01`
  - For collectons: `npm run test:02`
- Practice until all tests are passed.

## Help
> If the comment is like this:  
> `@type {number} members - value: 11`  
> you have to declare a number typed variable with the 11 initial value:
> `member: number = 11;`  
> __Important: the variable is in a Class, therefore the const or let keywords are unecessary.__
